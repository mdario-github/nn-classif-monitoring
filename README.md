# nn-classif-monitoring

A repository for working on monitoring neural-network on classification tasks. This work intends to use the OOD detection toolbox `oodeel` (see [here](https://github.com/deel-ai/oodeel/tree/master)) and adapt it to easily reproduce the results of different studies in the field of monitoring. 

## TODO 

- [x] Install and play around the `oodeel` toolbox and prepare adaptations
- [ ] Adapt the toolbox to save the extracted features (time saver for repetitive studies)
- [ ] Adapt the toolbox to save monitors once trained (to avoid fit over large datasets)
- [ ] Reproduce the results of the "Out-of-Distribution Detection is not All You Need" paper ()
- [ ] Reproduce the results of the "" ()
